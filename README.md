## About Me
I'm a Mod 2 student in the Front-End program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). That means I've been a dev for about 8 weeks! Find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/alycia-canavan), and check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/alyciacan).

## Wins 🏆 and Challenges 😠 
🏆 I pushed myself to complete this project a day ahead of schedule, to make extra time for studying!   
🏆 I had a lot of fun writing classes (I geek out on class-to-class interactions!)      
🏆 This was my first time diving in test-first!     
😠 I found writing all my own imports/exports a bit challenging        
😠 I'd love to have a few more days to add some extra fun features!
